# my-portfolio-express-nodejs
 
In this project, I'll create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I'll have a chance to share contact info, practice my elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least my first five projects from this Techdegree.

I'll create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I'll use Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I'll use Node.js and Express to:

    Import the required dependencies
    Link the JSON with the Pug templates
    Set up routes to handle requests
    Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
    Handle errors
    Set up a server to serve the project

CSS Style Modifications:

    Changed body bg-color
    Changed sidebar bg-color
    Changed sidebar h5 text-color
    Added border radius at sidebar profile-pic
